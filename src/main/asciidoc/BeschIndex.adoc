= Getting Started With Spring REST Docs

Active version of project: {project-version}

This is an example output for a service running at http://localhost:8080:

== Persons

=== Persons request
include::{snippets}/persons/http-request.adoc[]

=== Persons response
include::{snippets}/persons/http-response.adoc[]

=== Persons name request
include::{snippets}/persons/name/http-request.adoc[]

=== Persons name response
include::{snippets}/persons/name/http-response.adoc[]

As you can see the format is very simple, and in fact you always get the same message.
